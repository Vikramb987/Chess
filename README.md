# Chess
A fully-functional chess simulator in which you can play against another player or the computer AI. The computer uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for a simple AI. The AI is set to depth = 2, meaning it looks only 1 move into the future --- should be pretty easy to beat.

Run using the command "python chess.py" on the command line/terminal.
